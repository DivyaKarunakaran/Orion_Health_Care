I have developed a frontend responsive website using Angular MVC, HTML5 and SASS , that reads data from JSON file - http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users file and render it into view (user Interface).
1.	Application retrieves data from JSON using MVC framework
2.	Presented with usersâ€™ list in the alphabetical order and with search option on the interface. Asynchronously we can search for a specific user. The search option does supports searching the First Name and the Last Name.
3.	User can click on the name to view more details of the contacts in the form of Business card
